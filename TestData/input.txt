MESSAGE FROM NACIS XII
PROGRAM CHAIR
The Twelfth Annual Meeting of
ACIS will be held October 14 - 17
in St. Paul, Minnesota. As always
the NACIS Conference will
provide an open and professional
atmosphere for the exchange of
information and ideas for all who
are interested in maps and cartography. 
This year's program
promises to be quite exciting.
Highlights include addresses by
the dean of American cartography,
Arthur H. Robinson, and John
Fraser Hart, former president of
the Association of American
Geographers.
The latest research developments in cartography, most
notably in the areas of animated
mapping, cognitive cartography,
cartographic education, and map
librarianship will be presented.
Other sessions will explore recent
developments in software and
hardware for cartographic production, federal mapping initiatives,
and map library services and
access. In addition, this year
ACIS will be sponsoring a series
of "hands-on" workshops on
animation in cartography and
thematic map design using the PC.

MESSAGE FROM THE EDITOR
This issue marks some changes for
Cartographic Perspectives. Although
the design and overall look of the
publication remain the same (at
least I hope it does when it goes to
press), there have been some
significant changes. One of these
is a change in editorship of the
journal. David DiBiase, who had
served as editor of CP since its first
issue in March of 1989, completed
his tenure as editor with issue No.
12 (now known as the "white
issue"). I know I speak for every
ACIS member in thanking Dave
for making CP a journal of high
quality in both its content and
design. I personally appreciate his
assistance in making the editorial
transition go smoothly. Many of
the contributions in this current
issue were initiated, and in some
cases already completed for me, by
Dave and his staff at Penn State. l
can only hope that we can continue to produce a publication of
equal quality.
Another notable change marked
by this issue is that instead of a
single Featured Article, this issue
has two Featured Articles. It is my
hope, and that of the Editorial
Board, that this precedent continues 
and that the cartographic
community benefit from the
increased scholarly contribution
that CP can make. We wish to
encourage submission of manuscripts 
as well as all other items of
interest for publication consideration. 
Guidelines for papers and
submissions appear at the end of
this issue.
We will be publishing CP three
times per year. We have targeted a
Fall, Winter, and Spring publication schedule. This issue (Number
13, Fall 1992) has important
information about NACIS XII.
The meeting will be held in St.
Paul, Minnesota from October 14 -                          
17.  ACIS members should have
already received (or shortly will
receive) a conference schedule        
program and registration forms,
however, we have also included
this information on pages 31 - 33 of
this issue. You should note that
NACIS is conducting three workshops 
this year: Macintosh Animation, IBM Animation, and Map
Production and Design These
workshops will provide an excellent 
opportunity to get hands-on
exposure to some of the new and
exciting techniques that are
changing the way we conceive,
store, and use maps. I urge
anyone that can take advantage of
these workshops to do so.
Finally, I would like to encourage each of you to let us know if
you have suggestions for improving the quality and content of CP.
Your input will be greatly appreciated and not ignored. I look
forward to serving as editor and
hope that the information we
provide through CP is interesting,
informative, and beneficial.

The potential of computer animation has been realized in many different disciplines. Animation is also a powerful visualization tool for
cartography; however, it has been neglected until recently. This paper
portrays the need for animation in cartography in the light of the new
approaches and methods in the sciences as well as in society. It discusses 
two main reasons for the lack of animation in cartography: the
fixation on the printed map and the absence of a comprehensive approach to cartographic animation. Finally, a variety of issues for further
research are proposed.
C 
omputer animation has become an important visualization tool in
recent years. Improvements in computer hardware and software
have made the widespread use of computer animation possible. The
potential of computer animation has already been realized by different
disciplines, for example the film industry, architecture, fashion design and
the sciences.
Computer animation also has many potential uses in cartography. It
allows the creation of map sequences that can show spatial information
dynamically. Animated map sequences can depict time directly as a
cartographic variable, they can depict information mapped in different
ways; and they can present the map objects in a particular sequence. But
do we really need this sort of information display? Can animation really
show more than the presentation forms we already have, or is animation
only a toy for cartographers? To answer this, vve need to examine the
modern approaches and methods in the sciences as well as in society.
Spatial science has changed from the analysis of static states to the study
of processes. Researchers are no longer interested in studying only static
situations; they are more concerned with changes and forces that induce
or cause different states. Maps are an important tool for spatial scientists.
The static map, however, is not able to show processes directly. Of course,
cartographers have developed different methods for depicting changes,
but all of these methods reduce the dynamic aspects of reality to static
states that can hardly show the changes that take place. Cartographic
animation can do more by making the dynamic aspect of spatial changes
visible to the map user. Processes become more transparent using animation for their visualization.
Spatial science has also been influenced by system theory. Scientific
investigations are no longer concerned only with isolated phenomena;
they examine particularly the relationships and correlations of different
phenomena. Scientists need a representation form that can show all the
correlations. Static maps are not the best presentation form for displaying
these relationships. Often, maps are overloaded with information layers
to show the many correlations. ln an animated map sequence, map
elements can be presented in different orders and combinations to make
the spatial relationships more apparent. The map user can be directed
through the presented subject, and the correlations can be brought to the
user's attention.
In the late 1980s, the sciences discovered scientific visualization. It is
used for data analysis to see patterns that either answer questions or that
pose new and unexpected questions. Scientific visualization requires
computer animation, especially interactive animation, that can show the

data set in many different ways. The static map does not have this
flexibility in information display; it can show information only in one
\•;ay, so it is not a suitable instrument.
Finally, one should look at the map users of the future - the children of
today. This young generation is often called "the video generation" because
it has grown up with video and computer games. These children are more
accustomed to the computer than most adults; the interactivity and dynamic
aspects of computer games are a matter of course for them. At some schools
computers with interactive and dynamic programs are used as a didactic
device lo rouse the students' interest. Jn this respect, cartographers have to
ask if the traditional static map will be a good communication medium for
these future map users or whether we should look for alternati\'e forms.
Animated map sequences that can be controlled interactively are an alternative.
It seems that cartographic animation is more than a nice toy and should
be viewed as a powerful visualization tool for cartography that transcends
the potential of the printed map. In spite of this potential, computer
animation has been neglected in cartography until recently. Two main
reasons for the absence of animation in cartography will be discussed in
the following two sections. The first and most important reason is the
fixation on the paper map; the second, resulting from the first, is the
absence of a complete and systematic approach to cartographic animation.
The traditional printed map is regarded by cartographers as an excellent
form of presentation. IL is considered to be a product that has ilttained near
perfection in a long evolutionary process. Many representational methods
and techniques have been developed for topographic and thematic maps
which, in general, enable the creation of good maps. Also, the map user is
accustomed to the printed map and presumably he wants to have a "real"
map, a paper map. Thus, one can say that the traditional printed map is a
standard for both the mapmaker and the map user.  'ew techniques and
methods, such as the use of computers in cartography, are always compared
with and measured against the printed map and evaluated accordingly. This
is perhaps especially true in Europe as Gillessen (1986, p.53), a German
cartographer, states:
"Thi! t?xcellence of maps produced in Central Europe placL"i high quality demands
on altern,1tive mapping •.olutions and is therewith a standard of qua lit~    for all new
de\'Clopmcnh m c.utography. [ ... ]One would go so for as to sa\ that the high
standard of cartographv in Central Europe has hampered the development and the
willingne-.s to accept the products of any new technology[ ... [ in cartography."
This c.1uote illustrates the extent of Lhe fixation on the printed map. As
a result of this thinking, other and perhaps better information displays
are overlooked and the standard map is not placed in question.
If one asks why the traditional map is used as the standard, many
arguments are listed in its favor:                      
- traditional maps are though to be more attractive than computer
generated maps;        
- text, line and other symbols are though to be more "alive" on a traditional 
map and not as artificial or synthetic in appearance;                                      
- it attracts the eye and keeps the map user's attention.
All these arguments are based on the aesthetic impression of a map.
The exterior appearance is a very important criterion in its evaluation.
The importance of beauty in a map can also be found in a common
definition of cartography as the art and science of map making. But, can
the aesthetic value of a map continue to be one of the most important 
Number 13, Fall 1992                   cartographic perspectives                        5
criteria for judging the quality of a map? "'vtaps are the carrier'> of information in the process of communication and should they not be e\'aluated in
this light as well? So the question to ask is whether the traditional map is
really the best presentation form.
The use of computers in cartography offers new forms of information
display. Howe,.er, because we are still fixated on the traditional map, we
overlook this potential and use the computers predominantly to mimic
manual methods.
If one looks more closely at the application of computers in cartography, 
one sees that they have been extensively used to shorten time and
work intensive tasks. Data processing and drafting have been automated
and interactive computer systems now facilitate the map de!:iign process.
Languages like Post!:icript allow the direct transfer of maps between the
display and the image setter. The main efforts have been directed in
making computer-created maps as good as the traditional map.
The fixation on the printed map ''"'ithin computer cartography can be
further demonstrated with regard to the German ATKIS project (Authorized 
Topographic Cartographic Information System) that will contain the
data of the topographic maps of Germany in digital form. The purpose of
ATKJS is to make possible the digital production of topographic maps that
can be updated quickly and easily, and the creation of special purpose
maps of single topics. The maps that are generated from ATKIS are the
traditional paper maps.  ew forms of information display are not a goal
of A TKlS. Harbeck (1989, p.98), one of the designers of A TKIS, states in
this context:
"Without doubt at the end of the digital topographic mform,11ton sy .. tem tht.!re b the
cartogrnphic output   the map. \\ hether this product i., on the compuh:r display or a
printed map depend., on the user. But surely it can be .,tah:d that th!.! color printed
m,1p will continue to h.we its importance - perhaps en•n gain in import,1nce as a
commud1t\"
The fixation on the traditional map and on paper as the primary output
medium is strongly present within cartography. Jf we do not overcome
this fixation, we may ignore new forms of information display and we
may not reali7e their potential.
As a result of the fixation on the printed map, other forms of information
display have been overlooked and too little research has been done in this
area. This is true for cartographic animation.
The potential of animation for cartography was initially described by
Thrower (1961) and by Cornwell and Robinson (1966). l\evertheless, only a
small amount of work has been done in this field. In the 1970s, when
computer animation became available, indi\'idual cartographers used animation predominantly to show spatial changes over time. The efforts were
focused on producing animated map sequences for special issues like the
grO\vth of a city (Tobler 1970), traffic accidents (\1oellering 1976), population
gro\.vth in urban regions (Rase 1974) and animation of three dimensional
objects (Moellering 1980). Most of the 1980s saw no further work in cartographic animation.  ot until the end of the 1980s was cartographic animation rediscovered when cartographers realized the potential of animation for
the depiction and exploration of spatial and statistical relationships and
patterns. Some authors again called attention to the potential of cartographic
animation (Campbell and Egbert1990),and a few new animation techniques
were suggested for the analysis of spatio-temporal data (Monmonier 1989
and 1990) and the study of geoscientific processes (OiBiase et. al. 1991). In

REQUIRED RESEARCH   
addition, a program for animating choropleth maps was created (MacChoro
II 1989).
All these works employed the application of cartographic animation.
Most of them exclusively deal with the reali7ation of an animated map
sequence for one special issue. Only the later works pick up a more
common and extensive attempt at the cartographic application of
animation.
These are important contributions, but they arc individual solutions to
individual problems. A comprehensive and systematic approach to the
use of animation in cartography does not exist. Ytany essential issues
have not been examined. Therefore, basic kno'vvledge about design,
perception and production of animated map sequences is not available.
There are no principles that tell cartographers hO\'\' to make and design
animated maps. Without extensive knowledge of the creation of animated
maps, cartographic animation cannot be applied widely and efficiently; it
can be used only sporadically because too many design issues will need to
be worked out for each single application. If the influence of animation in
cartography is to increase, we must expand our knowledge about cartographic animation and develop a comprehensive and systematic approach
to it. This will require intensive research in different areas.
Future research in cartographic animation has to deal with a
variety of questions. The following issues must be examined:
Definition of cartographic animation
The absence of a systematic approach to cartographic animation becomes
particularly evident when we arrive at the question: What is cartographic
animation? There docs not seem to be a consensus. Can animation be used
only for map sequences that depict changes over time, or can it also be used
for map sequences without a time element that show changes in the presentation form orcreatea map in a sequential form? Can animation be used only
for complex map c;,equences created by a special animation technique, or is a
simple "slide show" abo an animation? What are the characteristics of
animation and how can it be defined? This should be the first question to be
examined.
Cartographic applications
Most of the work in cartographic animation has been done in this area.
However, the issue has not been handled in its entirety. Further work
must investigate which other or new forms of animation are possible and
whether they are useful. For this we have to examine different map types
and their possibilities for cartographic animation. Perhaps we \vill find
new forms of animated maps. A great deal of experimentation must be
done within this issue.
Graphic design of animated maps
Animated map sequences are different from the maps \\'e ordinarily use.
They are predominantly displayed ona CRT, are not static but dynamic, and
are often shown very quickly. We must examine how such maps must be
designed. Some research on the design of maps on the computer display
already exists and we can also look to television to find some ideas about the
layout of pictures and the use of color. The next question is: Must we consider
the dynamic aspect of map sequences when \Ne symbolize single maps? For
example, how do weselectdifferentdensities in an animated choroplethrnap
sequence, or what about labeling isolines in an animated map? And finally,
there is the aspect of map complexity. In an animated map sequence the user 
Number 13, Fall 1992                  cartograplzic perspectives                         7
will see a single map for only a short time, so the map cannot be too complex.
But how complt.?'\ can the map be? These issues must be tested.
Legend design
Animated map sequences are different than static maps, therefore, the
legend, the explanation of a map, should be different in an animated map.
How must it be designed? Multimedia offer the possibility to combine
animation .with sound. Therefore, the legend can be an audio explanation.
But is an audio explanation sufficient for the complete understanding of
the animation, or must it be completed by a visual legend? If we need a
graphical legend, we have to think about the design. Surely, it would
have to be a dynamic legend; ho.wever, it also must be readable for the
user.
Speed of animated sequences
We know that in computer animation 20-25 pictures ph second are
required for the perception of a continuous movement or change. But we
do not know how fast an animated sequence created for the depiction of
relationships must be, so that the user can recognize the objects and
relationships of the map sequence. This is a problem especially for
animation on video because the sequences cannot be controlled by the
user and the speed cannot be changed.
Creation and control of an animated map sequence
Cartographic animation will become a widespread visualization tool only
if the creation of animated map sequences is not too difficult. A user
interface that allows the user to produce animations easily has to be
designed. For thb, useful cartographic animation functions such as
changing the view-point or moving an object must be defined and arranged in menus. With these various animation operations, the user has
the potential to compose complex animation sequences. Ideas for this
have been suggested by Monmonier (1989). A second and very important
point is the interactivity of an animation. If animation is to be more than
just a film, it must have the possibility of interaction. Animation systems
should have the minimum ability to stop and restart the sequence and to
change the speed. The animation for graphical exploration of a data set
must have a \'ar1ety of controlling functions. We have to think about the
whole range of interactions that cartographic animation requires.
Animation techniques
We also need more knowledge of the different animation techniques and
for what types of animation they work best. Our experience in this area is
limited because only a few cartographic animations ha,.e been realized.
Gersmehl (1990) has examined this issue and describes nine animation
metaphors and their use. Further work should expand this subject.
Cartographic animation requires a variety of research on design,
creation, and use of animated map sequences. Because of the potential of
animation for cartography, more attention to research is required in this
field.
The potential of computer animation has already been realized by different disciplines. It can also be used for cartography as a powerful visualization tool that transcends the potential of the printed map. With animation, dynamic and interactive map sequences can be created that show
changes over time or can be used to depict or explore spatial and statistical relationships.

e\'\' approaches and methods in spatial sciences such as the strong
emphasis on examining processes and correlations and the use of scientific
visualization require a more dynamic and user-oriented form of information display that is not possible ,,.ith the printed map. Also, the map users
of the future, the children of today, who are more accustomed to interactive computers, will probably ask for more dynamic and interactive forms
of information display.
In spite of the need for computer animation in cartography, it has been
neglected until recently. There arc two main reasons for this. The first is
the fixation on the traditional printed map that is strongly present within
cartography. As a result of this thinking, other and perhaps better forms
of information display such as computer animation ha\'e been overlooked.
The second reason is the absence of a comprehensive approach to cartographic animation. Because of the fixation on the traditional map, too

research has dealt with the application of animation in cartography, and
many essential issues ha\'e not been examined. Therefore, basic knowledge about design, perception and creation of animated map sequences is
not a\.ailable. If the potential for animation in cartography is to be realized, we need a comprehensive and systematic approach to cartographic
animation. This"' ill require intem.ive research focusing on the definition,
application, design, creation and control of animated map <>equences as
well as on animation techniques and their uses.

When n GJS is used to compile,
nnalyz.e, nnd display infor111ntio11, 
the chance for 111zacceptable or variable data quality is
high due to the merging of
11111/tiple data layers.  
Visualizing Uncertain Information
When a GJS is used to drive map-based visualization, exploration of
potential relationships takes precedence over presentation of facts. In
these early stages of scientific analysis or policy formulation, providing
a way for analysts to assess uncertainty in the data they are exploring is
critical to the perspectives they form and the approaches they decide to
pursue. As a basis from which to develop methods for visualizing
uncertain information, this paper addresses the difference between data
quality and uncertainty, the application of Berlin's graphic variables to
the representation of uncertainty, conceptual models of spatial uncertainty as they relate to kinds of cartographic symbolization, and categories 
of user interfaces suited to presenting data and uncertainty about
that data. Also touched on is the issue of how we might evaluate our
attempts to depict uncertain information on maps.
U ncertainty i<. a critical issue in geographic \'isualization due to the
tendency of most people to treat both maps and computers as
somehow less fallible than the humans who make deci!>ions based on
them. When a G!S is uc;ed to compile, analy;'e, and display information,
the chance for unacceptable or variable data quality is high due to the
merging of multiple data layers. Together with these data quality issues,
the flexibility of data manipulation that makes GIS so powerful can lead to
considerable uncertainty in map displays produced at various stages of
G!S analysi .... This paper addresses a variety of conceptual issues underlying de\'elopment of \'i<;ualization tools that allow analyo.,t<; to take this
uncertainty into account in their research and policy formulation acti,.ities.
There io., a o.,trong tradition in cartography of attention to data quality.
Only rudimentary steps, however, have been made thus far to deal \.\'ith
the complex issues of \'isualizing data quality for multidimensional data
displays used in image analysis and GIS application<;. The importance of
this topic is evidenced by the decision of the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis(. CGIA) to make visualization of data
quality the first visualization initiative undertaken by the center.
Kate Beard and Barbara Buttenfield (1991 ), presenting the  CGIA
position, indicate that quality of spatial information "relates to accuracy,
error, consistency, and reliability." These aspects of quality are meant to
apply to more than locational verity. It is useful to begin consideration of
qua!it\ i<.sues with the framework of the Proposed Digital Cartographic

racy, attribute accuracy, logical consistency (i.e., a data structure whose
topology makes sense), completeness (comprehensive data and systematic
ways of dealing with missing values) and finally lineage.
The above quality categories are important, but to use a GIS effectively
for either scientific inquiry or policy formulation, the scope must be
broadened. In risk assessment circles, the term uncertainty has gained
some acceptance and I suggest that we might be better off if we follow
their lead (Morgan and Henrion, 1990; Rejeski and Kapuscinski, 1990).
Analysts never know the precise amount of error in any particular data
object - otherwise they '"'ould correct the error. They are more or less
uncertain about the available characterization of particular data objects.
From this perspecti\'e alone, the term uncertainty might be a better
description of what the NCGIA (and many past cartographers) ha,.e been
calling quality. In addition, however, uncertainty includes something of
importance beyond the narrow definition of quality that the  CGIA
initiative seems to be directed toward. A brief example will illustrate the
difference between a focus on quality and on uncertainty and why it is the
latter that should guide our efforts.
Imagine a single census block in a city. You have sent an enumerator
out to lake the census. In this particular case, the response rate is 90%. In
data quality terms, we might say that our population and income information for this block is of less than perfect quality because of the lack of
"completeness" in the data. Further, there may be "attribute inaccuracy"
in the data collected due to misunderstanding of the survey questions or
deliberate misinformation about items such as income or education, or
"spatial inaccuracy" due to address coding errors by the census enumerator. 
If, in the adjacent census block we somehow achieved 100o/c participation in the census, everyone understood the questions and gave truthful
responses, and the enumerator made no mistakes, a dnta quality assessment would label that unit's data as perfect. What we will be leaving out
of this assessment is the issue of variability (over both space and time and
within categories). This latter point is made quite forcefully by Langford
and Unwin (1991) who argue that, for the mapping of most socio-economic phenomena, a choropleth map of aggregated data for enumeration
units is "a poor choice" due to extreme within-unit variability that is the
rule rather than the exception.
ln addition to ,.ariability due to spatial aggregation, attribute aggregation 
add ... additional variability, and therefore, uncertainty. All data are
categori?ed. Even when individual measurements are retained in the
database, categories will be implicitly defined by the mathematical
precision of individual measurements. For example, temperatures might
be measured to the nearest degree. Most data in a GlS, however, will be
grouped into much broader categories (e.g., soil classifications, income
brackets, whether a house has indoor plumbing or not, etc.). In all of these
cases, the categorization introduces uncertainty even when the data are of
high quality.
We can only be certain that a particular location - a particular data
object - fits somewhere \.Vithin the attribute bounds of the categories and
the spatial bounds of the enumeration unit to which it is aggregated. The
aggregate totals for our census blocks disguise the variability within those
census blocks. Our level of uncertainty about map locations will be a
function not only of the quality of values (as defined above), but of
variance around the mean values we typically use to represent the unit,
and of spatial variability across the unit.
In addition to spatial and attribute data quality and variability, a final
uncertainty to be dealt with is temporal. The data, even if accurate and      
We can only be certain that a
particular locatio11 - a particular data object-fits somewhere .within tlze attribute
bo!lnds of the categories and the
spatial bou11ds of the enumeration 
1111it to .which it is aggregated .

homogeneous, represent a snapshot at one point in time. Our uncertainty
about their veracity will increase due to uncertainty about temporal
information, resolution with \\rhich that temporal information is specified,
and the difference in time between data collection and data use. The
temporally induced uncertainty will vary with the kind of phenomena
being represented.
When we use a GIS, the important issue is the quality of the decisions
we make - about a research course to follow, an urban development
policy to impose, or an environmental regulation to enforce. Whether we
use the term data quality or data uncertainty matters less than whether the
tool we give the GJS user is adequate for deciding how much faith to put
in any particular piece of information extracted from the database.
We can have highly accurate data while still having imprcrne data. This
lack of precision is at least as important an issue as a lack of accuracy.
Precision here refers, not only to the specificity of data values in terms of
significant digits, but in a more general sense to "the degree of refinement
\.vith which an operation is performed or a measurement taken" (Weli:.ter'.;;
N<:w Collegwte Dicticman1, 1974). In this sense it is an assessment of the
resolution of categories by which a phenomenon is represented (i.e.,
categorical precision). Although, mathematically, a population density of
165.3-1 persons/ sq. mi. would be considered precise, spatially it is not if
that county is 1000 sq. mi. in size. Abo, the map representation of the
attribute (population density) becomes categorically imprecise when the
data are aggregated into an attribute category ranging from 50-500 persons/ sq. mi. Figure 1 provides examples of topics for which map uncertainty is due primarily to accuracy or categorical precision.
As has been pointed out elsewhere, the term r·i~11ali:ntio11            has a number of
definitions (MacEachren and Ganter, 1990; \itacEachren, et. al., 1992).
Here it will be considered a human ability to develop mental image,
(often of relationships that have no visible form) together .with the use of
tools that can facilitate and augment this ability. Successful visualization
tools allo"v our visual and cognitive processes to almost automatically
focus on the patterns depicted rather than on mentally generating those
patterns.
Following from the above conception of visualization, a research
agenda to address visualizing uncertain information should include
attention to the cognitive issues of what it means to understand attribute,
spatial, and temporal uncertainty and the implications of this understanding for decision making and for symbolizing and categorizing uncertainty.
At the most basic level, uncertainty can be divided into two components
that might require different visualization strategies: \'isualizing accuracy
and visualizing precision. In addition, attention should be directed toward
the methodological, technical, and ergonomic issue:; of generating displays and creating interfaces that work. It is, of course, also essential to
develop methods for assessing and measuring uncertainty before we can
represent it. This latter topic, howe\'er, will not be addressed here.
Varied goals and needs - categories of interaction with data
If we continue to attack cartographic questions with our communication
model \'isors on, \.Ve will fail to take advantage of the power that GIS and
visualization tools provide. The search for the "optimal" data quality
visualization tool might prove as fruitless as the search for the optimal
graduated circle map. lt is critical to recognize that GIS and visualization
tools attached to them are used for a range of problem types that may
have quite different visualization needs in general, and visualization 
Number 13, Fall 1992                   cartographic perspectives                       13
quality needs specifically. David
DiBiasc (1990) recently developed
a graphic model of the range of
uses to which graphics might be
put in scientific research (fig. 2). I
believe that his basic model is
relevant, not only to science, but to
applied spatial decision making
with a GIS.
As we begin to consider the
visualization of w1certainty, we
need to be cognizant of this range
of visualization goals and environments 
and the varying information
requirements it implies. The kind
of uncertainty and the tools used
to visualize it are likely to vary
across this range, from the use of
GIS by an EPA scientist exploring
the spatial distribution of a pollutant to the use of GIS driven map
displays by policy makers trying to
decide which industries to add to
the list of those regulated for toxic
waste emission.
Graphics variables
Because few GIS users are trained in cartographic symbolization and
design, it will be necessary to create expert systems that logically translate
information into graphic displays. Jacques Bertin, the French cartographer I graphic theorist, has had a tremendous impact on our approach to
this problem. The Robinson et. al., text (1984) that is used by 50% of
introductory cartography courses in the country (Fryman, 1990) cites
Bertin's basic system of graphic variables (location, size, value, texture,
color, orientation, and shape) as the fundamental units we can use to build
a map image. Monrnonier and Johnson's (1990) recent guide to map
design for environmental GIS also presents Bertin's system as an important organizing concept for well-designed maps. Weibel and Buttenfield
(1988), in a paper on map design for GIS, and Muller and Zeshen (1990), in
a paper on expert systems for map design, accept this system as a base to
build from in designing expert systems for map symbolization.
An important representation issue for visualization of uncertainty,
therefore, is how Bertin's graphic variables (with possible additions or
modifications) might be logically matched with different kinds of data
uncertainty. A critical distinction, of course, is that between ordered and
differential graphic variables which can be logically associated with
ordered/numerical and nominal/categorical differences among phenomena. Of Bertin's original graphic variables, size and value are most appropriate for depicting uncertainty in numerical information, while color
(hue), shape, and perhaps orientation can be used for uncertainty in
nominal information. Texture, although it has an order, might work best
in a binary classification of "certain enough" and "not certain enough"
that could be used for either nominal or numerical data.
Although Bertin ignored it, the graphic variable that is arguably the
most logical one to use for depicting uncertainty is color saturation.
Saturation, added to the list of variables by Morrison (1974), is sometimes

referred to as color purity. Saturation could be varied from pure hues for
very certain information to unsaturated (grey) hues for uncertain information. 
Another variable, beyond Bertin's original seven, that seems quite
promising as an uncertainty visualization tool is "focus."2 Presenting data
"out of focus" (as you would see it with an out-of-focus camera), or
simply at lower spatial resolution, might be an ideal way to depict uncertainty.
Symbol focus can be manipulated in at least four \'l'ays:
Contour crispness-The most obvious way to apply focus is to vary
the "crispness" or "funyness" of symbol contours (edges). A certain
boundary (e.g., the U.S. - Canada border) might be depicted with a
sharp, narrow line, while an uncertain boundary (e.g., that between
Kuwait and Iraq) might be portrayed with a broad fuzzy line that fades
from the center toward the background (fig. 3). Similar "out-of-focus"
symbols could be used to represent certain or uncertain location of point
features, and an area may be depicted as not bounded at all, but as
fading in a continuous fashion from core to periphery (fig. 4).
Fill clarity- While contour crispness intuitively suggests uncertainty in
position, the crispness of elements making up interior fills for an otherwise 
precisely delineated area can be logically associated with attribute
uncertainty. A sharp, distinct pattern, for example, might be used to
indicate certainty while a less defined pattern might indicate uncertainty
(fig. 5).
Fog- The transparency of the "atmosphere" thnt an analyst views a
map through can be controlled on some computer display devices. lt is
possible to create what, in effect, looks like a fog passing between the
analyst and the map - the thicker the fog, the more uncertain that part of
the map (fig. 6).3
Resolution-Often maps are produced in which attribute data, geographic position, and temporal position are depicted with very different
resolutions. One method of communicating uncertainty would be to
adjust the resolution of geographic detail so that it corresponds to that of
attributes or time (e.g., adjust resolution with which coastlines are depicted 
on a world map to correspond to the resolution of thematic information depicted) (fig. 7).
Linking visualization tools to models of uncertainty
Different uncertainty visualization issues will arise when dealing with
different kinds of data (e.g., qualitative data on land use/land cover
versus quantitative data from the census). When data are quantities
aggregated to units such as counties, we should consider the spatial
characteristics of the phenomena represented by these quantities as we
select symbolization methods to depict the uncertainty about them. One
continuum of spatial characteristics that can be identified is that from
discrete (spatially fragmented) to continuous (spatially comprehensive)
phenomena (Hsu, 1979). A second continuum relates to the character of
variation in the phenomenon across space. Some phenomena (e.g., tax
rates) can vary quite abruptly as political boundaries are crossed, while
others (e.g., ga!Jons of ground water pumped for irrigation per county)
can exhibit a relatively smooth variation quite independent of the units to
which data are aggregated. MacEachren and DiBiase (1991) recently
'This variable appears to have been origin,1lly suggested bv Dadd Woodward in a
seminar at Wisconsin (D. Di Biase and j. Krygier, personal commumcation).
'TI1is idea was offered by Michael Goodchild during the '\JCGIA Visualization of Data
Quality Specialist Meeting. 
Number 13, Fall 1992                   cartographic perspectives                        15
proposed a series of graphic data
models that represent locations in
this continuity-abruptness phenomena 
space (fig. 8). These
graphil. data models correspond to
a range of two dimensional
symboli/ation methods, which
include standard forms such as
dot, choropleth, isopleth, and
graduated symbol, along with
some hybrid techniques designed
to deal with the midpoints on the
phenomena space axes (fig. 9).
Three research questions suggest
themseh.es here: Is it safe to
assume that the spatial characteristics of uncertainty •.vill mimic those
of the phenomena that uncertainty
is being estimated for? Do specific
symbolization methods actually
communicate the particular spatial
characterbtics that we as cartographers associate them with (e.g., is a
layer tinted isarithmic map
depicting uncertainty in air
pollution estimates interpreted as a
smooth continuous surface or as
discrete uncertainty regions)?
What approach should be followed
when a data set has multiple kinds
of uncertainty associated with it
and the spatial characteristics of
that uncertainty vary?

represent uncertainty is the question of how and when to present the
representation. This is complicated by the likelihood that GIS representations 
are often products of a combination of measured and model-derived
multivariate data. There seem to be three choices that could be used
separntely or in combination:
map pairs in which a data map is depicted side-by-side with a map of
uncertainty about that data (fig. 10);
seq11e11tinl presentation in which a user might be warned about uncertainty 
with an initial map .which is followed by a map of the data (fig. 11),
(or interactive tools that allow toggling between the data and the uncertainty representations);
bi-variate maps in which both the data of interest and the uncertainty
estimate are incorporated in the same map (fig. 12).
Most attempts thus far to graphically depict uncertainty of spatial data
have used the map pair strategy (e.g., Borrough, 1986; MacEachren, 1985;
MacEachren and Davidson, 1987). Cartographers have spent relatively
little time investigating the impact of sequential information presentation.

begun to bring attention to this issue
(Taylor, 1982; Slocum, 1988). One
clear avenue to explore here is the
potential of hypertext to allow users
to navigate through the maze of
data and uncertainty representations that we might be able to
provide (e.g., use of graphic scripts
to guide this process (\1onmonier,
1992)).
In relation to the third possibility,
bivariate maps, the l..J.S. Census
Bureau's bi-\'ariate choropleth maps
from the 1970 census are perhaps
the best known attempt to relate
two \'ariables on one map. Experimentation with those maps by
several researchers indicates that
untrained readers have considerable
trouble reading bi-variate maps
(e.g., Olson, 1981 ). There are,
hO\.vever, a number of bi-variate
mapping possibilities that have not
yet been investigated and previous
attempts to use bivariate maps dealt
\.vith two different variables rather
than with a single variable related to
its uncertainty. Color saturation (or
intensity), for example, might be
used as a graphic variable for
depicting uncertainty on maps in
which different hues are used to
represent the data values of interest
(e.g., on a land cover map). For
printed maps in black and white, a
combination of texture and value
may be effecti\.e (see fig. 12). The
variable of foett'> might be used in
similar ways.
In a dynamic visualization
environment, it would be possible
to combine sequencing and bivariate techniques and allow a fade
from a data map, through a data/
uncertainty map, back to the data
map. For qualitative areal data (e.g.,
soils) Fisher (1991) has suggested an
animated technique to communicate
the certainty (or uncertainty) of soil
classifications for particular locations.

classification. Certain sections of lhe map remain static and uncertain
sections exhibit continual blinking between (or among) the potential soils
for that place.
Evaluation of the utility or affect of providing uncertainty information
IL is relah\ ely easy to think up techniques by which uncertainty might be
represented. Before we try to put these techniques into practice (particularly in a public policy context), we should evaluate their potential impact.
The representation of uncertainty about information in a GIS provides a
unique opportunity to determine whether our efforts at map symbolization 
and design research over the past 40 years have provided the tools
required to develop a representation system. If past perceptual
and cognitive research along with the conceptual
models of symbol-referent relationships based on
l'is11rc 11:                                                        semiotics are really

useful, we should be able to use them
to formulate hypothe     se~   and design appropriate
e'\periments in our que<.t for ans.,,,.ers about
visualizing uncertainty.
This possibility may tempt some of us to go back to our roots
in the communication model approach to cartography. Communication of
data quality or uncertainty seems to be the ideal case for which the
communication model was developed. uncertainty can be treated as a
precisely defined piece of information that we want a GIS user to obtain.
am afraid, however, that if we follow this narrow information theory
approach we will hit the same dead ends that we did a decade or so ago.
This time around we need to be aware of the range of human-user
interactions with graphics that occur from initial data exploration to
presentation. For exploratory applications, .where there is no predetermined message to communicate, we cannot judge uncertainty depictions
using communication effectiveness standards. We can only evaluate these
depictions in terms of how they alter decision making, pattern recognition, hypothesis generation, or policy decisions. We also must be aware of
the fact that our (possibly) precise uncertainty information is conditioned
by the social-cultural context in which decisions about what to represent
are made (e.g., a variety of estimates exist about the reliability of the U.S.
Census Bureau's enumeration of homeless persons), and by the limited
ability of cartographers to determine the relative importance of various
kinds of quality or uncertainty information in a particular context.
In addition to the question of visualizing uncertainty, there is also a
question of quality of visualizations to consider. One way to evaluate                                                   
\ isualization of uncertainty tools, therefore, is to calibrate those tools in
terms of their tendency toward type I and type II visualization errors
(MacEachren and Ganter, 1990). Does providing uncertainty information
(or pro\'iding it in a particular .,,,ay) lead to a failure to notice patterns and
relationships (type Il), or to a tendency lo see patterns that do not exist
(type J)? "v1.aps are re-presentations and as such are always one choice
among many about ho\\ to re-present. There is always uncertainty in the
choice of representation method, therefore, representing the uncertainty in
our representations is an uncertain endeavor at best.

Geologic mappers arc perhaps the
preeminent applied users of maps.
The three-dimensional nature of
most geologic phenomena means
that geologists must be able to
read and manipulate a twodimensional map in many ways
unimagined by most geographers.
Perhaps the most difficult course
for undergraduate geologists to
master is the geological field camp
where geological maps are made.
Thu5, the complexity of the
techniques assures a need for
illustrated books showing the
fundamentab of geologic mapping.
This book is a welcome addition
to the sparse literature of this field.
It is composed of fifteen concise
chapters, each on a specific aspect
of geologic maps: for example,
cross-sections, portraying strike
and dip, unconformities, and folds.
The chapters are liberally illustrated with block diagrams and
easy-to-read figures summari7ing
various topics, and eight full-color
geologic map plates are included.
There are also chapters on topics
peripheral to interpreting geologic
maps, such as on old and new
techniques of producing geologic
maps, as well as on the heritage of
geologic mapmaking in Britain,
where geologic mapping essentially originated.
The book is mainly limited to a
discussion of geologic maps
produced in Britain and its former
colonies, especially the United        
States, Canada, Australia and New
Zealand. Discussion of geologic
mapping in other regions is mainly
limited to a few examples from
France. Despite this limited
geographic coverage, there are
substantial international differences between geologic maps in
the English speaking regions; the
able comparison of maps produced by different mapping
traditions is a laudable aspect of
this book.
Each chapter includes a brief
introduction, a discussion of the
topic, a chapter summary and an
annotated bibliography. Accompanying each chapter are several
map exercises demonstrating the
principles introduced in it. Many
questions are posed about each
map, but it is left to the reader to
complete them because no exercise
solutions are included. Because
the 24 map exercises are based on
8.5'' ' 11" black and white maps,
they can be easily reproduced for
repeated personal trials or classroom use.
It is apparent from the annotated bibliography that several
books about geologic mapping
have been published since I
completed my geological field
camp in 1981, when this kind of
reference book was unavailable.
Although this book would have
been an extremely useful reference
book at field camp, I might not
have graduated if my instructors
could have assigned some of the
complex exercises that it includes.
There is no question that anyone
who is able to complete all of the
exercises will ha\'e a thorough
knowledge of geologic maps and
the various interpretati\'e techniques that can be employed.
There are some minor problems
with this text, but none that
discourage me from recommending it. Although I found a few
typographical errors in the text
and exercises, the typical American reader will find a surprisingly
great difference between British      
and American spelling of geological terminology, \Vhich could be
confusing to the novice. In this age
of computer-typeset texts, a
publisher could ju5lify L\'\U printings of a scientific text •.vhen the
terminology is this divergent, with
each text using the lexicon of the
appropriate audience. In addition,
although this book is readily
understandable to a geologist with
a working knowledge of the
geologic time scale and basic
geologic principles, some of the
text could be much more difficult
for the typical American geology
undergraduate to use without such
background knowledge. More
importantly, a few of the black and
white exercises arc simply too
complex to use con\'entional
pattern symbols to differentiate the
areas. For example, because I am
familiar with the geology of the
Baraboo, Wisconsin area, I am
con\'inced that I could not determine the geological history of the
region to the extent reque5tcd in
the exercise, gi\.en the cartographic
complexity of the map included.
Thus, I am concerned that some of
the other exercise maps might be
similarly fla.wed. Finally, I would
recommend that the next edition
include a geologic time scale and a
chapter I pamphlet of accompanying exercise solutions.
Despite these criticism5, this
book is an excellent reference text
for field geologists. The diagrams
explaining each topic are very well
drawn, clnJ easily understandable
without reference to the text.
Although the book will be most
useful as a reference or field camp
text, for me the highlight of this
book was the entertaining stories
about some famous geologic
mappers. Like many Welshmen,
Professor Maltman is an excellent
story teller. He has done as good a
job writing captivating stories
about some famous geologists as
he has in clarifying the exceedingly
complex techniques of geologic
mapping.

Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) have developed to a stage
where production of a large
reference compendium is not only
feasible, as the editors state in their
preface to this work, but necessary.
TI1is two-volume set is a milestone
in the continuing development of
GIS in three respects: first, it
presents a comprehensive view of
GIS as an emerging technology;
second, it provides a reference
work for researchers and practicing GIS professionals; and third, it
attempts to develop the basis of
GIS as a discipline. The stated aim
of the book is to assemble a team
of international experts to write a
major reference work on GJS.
Although there is a significant
North American and European
(particularly the United Kingdom)
bicis, the editors have accomplished this aim. With only a few
flaws in the presentation, the work
is a monumental achievement and
will probably serve as the major
GIS reference for some years to
come.
The book is well organized into
four sections: 1) an introductory
overview with eight chapters
examining the definitions, history,
settings, and critique of GIS; 2)
principles of GIS consisting of 26
chapters arranged into subsections
concerning the nature of spatial       
data, digital representation,
functional, display, and operational issues; 3) applications of GIS
with 22 chapters in four subsections concerning national and
international programs, socioeconomic, en\'ironmental, and
management applications; and 4)
an epilogue which briefly summarizes the main ideas and presents
projections for the future. The
editors tie the work together by
providing an introductory article
for each of the first three sections
and by authoring the epilogue.
The book contains a table of
contents, preface, and list of
contributors with affiliation and
research interests repeated in each
of the two volumes. While each
article contains its own reference
list, each volume contains a
consolidated bibliography of some
60 pages, a six-page list of acronym definitions, an author index
which includes page numbers
where citations occur, and an
extensive subject index. The
repetition of the bibliography and
indices allows each volume to be
used independently but at the cost
of the extra pages.
The book is a good, comprehensive work meeting the need in the
GIS area for such a reference
volume. It is similar in some
respects to the Mnmtnf of Photogm111111etry 
and the Mm111nl of
Remote Se11si11g published by the
American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, but
unlike those manuals this book
does not present a rigid, factual
account of GIS. For example, one
cannot use this book to learn how
to program a quadtree data
structure or how to use relational
algebra to extract relevant geographical data attributes, as would
be expected in a manual. The
articles are more of a research
approach, some with speculation
and futurism. The book does
provide an excellent overview of
the general principles and applications of GIS, which is the intent. It    
is aimed at advanced undergraduates, postgraduates, professionals,
and research workers and succeeds at presenting the appropriate
inforrnalion Lo Lhis larget audience.
At the same time, GIS is an area
where criticism has been scarce.
This book is no different and the
editors lament the fact that in the
applications part of the work, no
examples of GIS failures are
included. The one chapter which
does level criticism focuses on
ideas of cartography's demise, the
booster atmosphere surrounding
crs, and the declarations of
success before implementation or
experimentation. That GIS leads to
improved spatial analysis is
usually not questioned, but this
aspect is the weakest of the system
and true spatial analysis is incorporated in few if any GIS. Several
chapters in this work echo this
criticism as well as the limitations
of GTS to handle three-dimensional
and temporal data. Also, the
chapter criticizes GlS researchers
and practitioners who are quick to
adopt new paradigms (currently
object-orientation has captured the
GIS collective imagination) and
hail them as the solution to representation of geographic data
before any implementation or
experimentation has been performed.
The section on principles of GIS
forms the core of this work and the
editors' introduction identifies a
small number of organizing
principles which have emerged in
GIS: raster versus vector, query
versus product, and spatial
analysis versus spatial information. 
The principles are organized
by identifying key scientific
questions of GIS which include the
nature of spatial data, digital
representation, functional, display,
and operational issues.
The applications section is a
good sampling of the possible
types of GIS applications. Its
limitation is that the breadth of the
current and potential applications 
22                          cartograpl1ic perspectives              Number 13, Fall 1992
cannot be effectively represented
in a ':>ingle volume.
In the epilogue the editors
reflect on the ideas presented
throughout the book and make
some statements about the current
status of GlS with a prognosis for
the future. It examines the outstanding issues in the research
agenda, projections to the year
2000, and hm ... GIS fits in the
bigger societal future. Briefly
examining its history, the editors
think GIS is converging upon a set
of generic issues through the use
of technology. These issues
include data capture, data modelling, accuracy, data volume, spatial
analysis, user interfaces, cost/
benefit analysis, and impacts on
organization'>. An argument is
made for geographic information
science instead of the technology
of GlS. While GIS was once seen
only as access to maps, it is now
viewed as access to the world
represented by maps. Drawing a
parallel to statistical packages, GlS
is said to be at the stage of those
packages in 1970. Sta tis tics
emerged as a discipline, will GIS
do the same or will it follmv the
path of remote sensing and remain
an interdisciplinary tool for all
spatial scientists?
While GIS has many of the
trappings of a discipline, including
journals, trade press, conferences,
textbooks, college classes and
curricula, is there a fundamental
set of problems for GIS to examine? 
Two views of GIS are put
fonvard, one in which GIS follows
the path of the quantitative
revolution in geography in the
1960s. Today few geographers,
particularly human geographers,
are concerned with quantification.
This view portrays GIS as the
Edsel of electronic data processing.
The second view projects continued 
com.ergence of ideas, disciplines, technologies, and a need for
the various application areas to
remain affiliated. The editors
prefer the second view and          
expound upon it in projections for
GIS to the year 2000.
In summary, the book is a major
step in developing a comprehensive view of GIS. While one may
not agree with the statements in
the introduction or the epilogue
(and there is contradiction among
the contributors), the editors are to
be commended for the production
of such a reference work. Flaws,
such as inclusion of the subsection
titles only in the table of contents
and not in the subsections themselves, 
some cited references
which do not appear in the reference 
list or in the consolidated
bibliography, and a few isolated
grammatical errors, are minor.
One major problem is the color
plates. Most are too small to be
effective (with as many as eight
per page), particularly in the
applications section, and in some
cases the graphics are completely
illegible. This problem notwithstanding, the book is an excellent
presentation of the framework of
GIS principles and provides a
reasonable survey of the major GIS
application areas with a few
detailed examples. The editors
elicit major themes in their introductions 
and tic the 56 chapters
together well. This work is likely
to become required reference
material for GIS students and
practitioners; it certainly belongs
on the bookshelf of every GlS
researcher.

Landsat commercialization will
reach a major milestone on September 30, 1992, when taxpayersubsidi7ed operation of the
program ends. Landsat is the
United States Civil remote sensing
satellite system operated by the
Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT). EOSAT announced it would assume opera-     
lion costs for Landsat on October
1, saving the taxpayer $19 million
in Fiscal Year 1993. Landsat 6 will
be completed and delivered to the
government in October and
.oAA has scheduled its launch
for January 23, 1993.
The first Landsat was launched
in 1972; since that time, an archive
of over 2.7 million images have
been created. These images are
extremely valuable and useful for
mapping, research, and monitoring the Earth's natural resources.
The Landsat Thematic Mapper
(T'v1) sensor collects data from a
broad region of the electromagnetic spectrum that includes
visible bands, near-infrared,
shortwave-infrared, and thermal
wavelengths. With Landsat's TM
30 x 30 meter resolution and large
area coverage (100x100 miles), the
sensor provides detailed information 
at relatively low cost per unit
area, compared to aerial photography or other commercial satellite
data. In addition, Landsat has
repeat coverage every 16 days.
TM data is well suited for many
environmental applications and is
used to inventory and monitor
world resources, wildlife habitats,
marine environments and minerals. 
Carla Adams, at EOSAT, has
compiled a brief description of
case studies of environmental
monitoring using Thematic
Mapper data. Examples include
the use of Landsat TM data to
input information into a geographic information system by the
Suwannee River Water Management District to help the regulatory 
and planning staff assess
where land cover is changing and
to locate areas where land use
could harm surface water. Shoreline changes in the Aral Sea are
being analyzed by comparing the
1977 Mi\115 mosaic and 1987
mosaic. The United States National CoastWatch Program
intends to use TM data to develop
a comprehensive nationally
standardi7ed GIS to assess changes             
' 

Number 13, Fall 1992                   cartograpliic perspectives                        23
in land co\.er and habitat in the
coastal regions of the United
States.
Because TM data provides
current land cover information, it
can be used to map urban cover,
update urban-rural boundaries,
and identify the urban fringe zone
for planning. Further examples of
TM data use for oil spill tracking,
water quality assessment, air
pollution, and global warming
demonstrate the vast amount of
analytical and mapping uses of
Landsat imagery and data.
Landsat 6 will provide even
further value of this data to the
mapping community with the
introduction of a 15 meter panchromatic band.
EOSAT is interested in making
Landsat data grants available to
researchers. Thev have made an
agreement with 'ASA to dedicate
up to 25o/c of productive capacity
to the collection of re earch data
selected by NASA, which will then
pay 50'1 of the list price for this
data set and .will distribute the
data to researchers for noncommercial use. EOSA Twill use all
revenues from these  ASA
purchases to make grants to
researchers.

Treasures Report
President Dodd asked that the
minutes from Board \1eetings of
October 20, 21, and 23, 1991 be
accepted and called upon Ed Hall
to present the Treasures Report.
Hall reports a balance of $23,203.10
in the NACIS account. Hall
reports on a declining rate of
interest being earned on the
balance. He spoke concerning the
need to establish a bank account
which will allow unlimited
deposits and withdra1.vals without
a loss of interest income. Dodd
suggests the present as timely in
terms of centralizing financial
operations to Milwaukee and
asked Baruth to explore banking
options in Wisconsin. Hall reports
the membership of  ACIS totals
280 active members, 44 institutional, 197 personal and 39 students.
NACIS XII
Jeff Patton, program chair, announced a call for papers for the
St. Paul program in various
publications. Further announcements will be made through a
direct mailing from our existing
list of potential participants. The
Board asked that Cartographic
Animation be added to the suggested topics list on the call for
papers. The paper submission        
deadline was moved back to June
1. Dodd offer!> the support of the
Board to aid Patton in any way
possible. Greg Chu addressed the
Board concerning local arrangements and offered potential guest
speakers. The local program
schedule will be distributed for
discussion during our summer
telephone conference. Brent
Allison will be a co-chair with Chu
on local arrangements. Chu is
investigating possible local field
trips, transportation requirements
and scheduling. The \1ap Library
at the Liniver!:>ity of Minnesota will
offer a reception on a non-banquet
night with a gathering at Chu'-.
restaurant to follO\v. Two concurrent work!:>hop will be held at the
University of \itinncsota. One will
address the uses of CorelDRA W
oftvvare and the other will deal
with animation cartography.
Enrollment is limited to 20 participants in each workshop. A fee
schedule was adopted as follows:
Corel Workshop - 550 for full
conference participants, $100 for
non conference participants and
$35 for !:>tudents.
Animated Cartography Workshop - $70 full, $125 non, and 545
student. Interest continues for
incorporating a workshop with
Mcintosh platforms as offered on
past occasions. Five enrollment
slots will be set aside in each
workshop for student participation. The possibility of a Sunday
workshop session exists if demand
warrants. Concluding remarks on
NACJS XH were offered by Ron
Bolton as he praises the preparation which has taken place to
insure a successful meeting.
NACIS XIII
The Board reviewed several
potential sites for the Washington
meeting as offered by Bolton.
Final selection went to the Quality
Hotel in Silver Springs, Maryland.
Dates for the meeting will be
finalized so as not to conflict with
1.C.G.E. Fred Anderson and Al 
Number 13, Fall 1992                  cartographic perspectives                        29

NACIS XI Final Report
The Board accepted a Final Expense/ lncome Report from Baruth
on the Milwaukee meeting. In
summary, the report showed
expenses totaling $6266.80 and
receipts totaling $6665.50 for a
positive balance of 5398.70. Total
conference attendance was reported 
at 92 participants.
Sutherland made a motion to
maintain the same fee structure for
full participants to  ACIS Xll as
was established for  ACIS Xl. The
motion was seconded and passed.
Jim Minton made a motion for a
daily registration fee to be set at
$25 for students and $45 for all
other conference participants
excluding meals. The motion was
seconded and passed.
Cartographic Perspectives
Baruth announced that Sona
Andrews had received approval
from her Dean to assume
editorship of C.P. Baruth read a
report prepared by Andrews
which outlined her progress
through this transitional period.
Patton points out that the Publications Committee has in the past
worked with the Editor in the
selection of feature articles. The
Board asks for the Publications
Committee Chair (Mike Peterson)
to work on revising the name of
the Committee to better reflect it's
function. Further, the term of
service on the Committee and the
professional composition of the
Committee members will be
reviewed. An emphasis on
academic representation on the
Publications Committee was felt to
be an asset in projecting a scholarly image of C.P. The Board joins
in the principal that C.P. should
take on the style of the Editor.
Formerly allotted funds for
publication software have not been
spent and remain at the disposal of    
the Editor. Dodd ask Baruth to
convey to Andrews the need to
publish C.P. in a timely manner.
Dodd further receives Board
support for production of a
brochure which promotes C.P. in
order to broaden subscription.
Chu suggests that the Review
Committee for refereeing articles
be placed in a more prominent
page position in C.P. Ed Hall
asked to be released from the
responsibility of maintaining the
current data base for C.P. mailing
labels. It was agree that this task
would be moved to Milwaukee.
Bolton asks Dodd to select with the
Editor a suitable time frame for
C.P. production. The Board joins
in thanking Dave DiBiase and his
staff for their years of service on
Cartographic Perspectives.
NACIS Dues Increase
This matter was tabled for later
discussion.
Nominating Committee
Fred Fryman asked that an announcement be placed in C.P. for
nominations to Board positions.
Dodd encourages members of
NAClS who have not served on
the Board to consider running for a
seat. Terms expire this year for
Bolton, Mclean, Fontanez and
Hall. A question arose concerning
the maintenance of a permanent
record of election results. Dodd
will contact Diana Riveria for
clarification on this matter.
Membership Growth
Subcommittee
In response to her interest, Barbara
Trapido has been asked to serve on
the subcommittee. Dodd will
select a new chair.
Centralization and Incorporation
Baruth reports that centralization
of NACIS operations continues in
Milwaukee. Incorporation of the
Society in Wisconsin has been
renewed with Baruth as the
register agent.                      
Mission Statement
The question arose concerning the
language of our mission statement
as it relates to our non-profit status
for postage permits. Baruth will
investigate permit application
procedures for mailings from
Milwaukee.
NACIS XIV
The Board discussed potential sites
for this meeting, drawing from
responses to a questionnaire
placed before the membership.
Dodd suggests the use of a private
research group to help in site
selection to relieve Bolton of this
arduous task. The Board felt that
NACIS should continue to seek
advisement from the membership
as to future sites. Patton spoke in
favor of Asheville,  orth Carolina.
As in the past, the problem of
finding members to serve on a
local arrangements committee
limited site options. Several
members of the Board spoke
convincingly of the merits of
Ottawa. Here the point was made
that our Society's name has not
lived up to our conference sites
selection along with a general
desire to incorporate more Canadians into  ACIS Minton and
Mclean will investigate facilities
and planning for an Ottawa
conference.
Cartographic Users Advisory
Council Representative
Ed Hall was nominated to be the
ACIS representative to C.U.A.C.
He accepted the nomination and
was elected to the post. McLean
offers a motion caJling for NACIS
to support C.U.A.C. through a 550
annual contribution. The motion
passed after discussion. Patton
offers a 1T1otion calling for NACIS
to support the Society's representative to C.U.A.C. with a nominal
contribution in order to help
defray the costs of attending
meetings. After discussion a
figure of $50 was arrived upon by
the Board. The motion was 
30                          cartograplzic perspectives              Number 13, Fall 1992
amended, voted upon, and passed.
Notebooks for President and Vice
President
Dodd spoke of the value of maintaining a notebook to be passed
through the succession of Presidents to aid in the continuity of the
Society's management. He i5 now
collecting such a notebook.
Other Business
Minton asks that it become a
practice of the President to present
a "State of the Society" report to
the Board which would address
committee assignments, duties of
office holders, and other matters
which reflect upon the well being
of the Society. The suggestion met
with Board support. Baruth asked
that a committee be formed to
address digital technology in the
library setting. Chu suggested a
future workshop on the matter.
Chu further suggests that Pat
McGlamory might offer another
conference session concerning this
important topic. After brief
discussion and yielding to the
pangs of hunger, President Dodd
finds that all necessary business
has been completed and adjourns
at 5:10 p.m.

*Membership fees include subscription to Cartograpltic Perspectives. 
The North American Cartographic Information Society
(NACIS) was founded in 1980 in response to the need for a multidisciplinary
organization to facilitate communication in the map information community. 
Principal objectives of NACIS are:                         
§ to promote communication, coordination, and cooperation
among the producers, disseminators, curators,
and users of cartographic information;                               
§ to support and coordinate activities with other professional
organizations and institutions involved with
cartographic information;
§to improve the use of cartographic materials through
education and to promote graphicacy;
§to promote and coordinate the acquisition, preservation,
and automated retrieval of all types of cartographic material;                                 
§ to influence government policy
on cartographic information.
NACIS is a professional society open to specialists from private, academic,
and government organizations throughout North America. The society
provides an opportunity for Map Makers, Map Keepers, Map Users, Map
Educators, and Map Distributors to exchange ideas, coordinate activities, and
improve map materials and map use.  Cartographic Perspectives, the
organization's Bulletin, provides a mechanism to facilitate timely
dissemination of cartographic information to this diverse constituency. It
includes solicited feature articles, synopses of articles appearing in obscure
or non-cartographic publications, software reviews, news features, reports
(conferences, map exhibits, new map series, government policy, new degree
programs, etc.), and listings of published maps and atlases, new computer
software, and software reviews.
